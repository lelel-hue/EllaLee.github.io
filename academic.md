### GaussMedAct: Gaussian-based Representation Learning for Fine-grained Medical Action Evaluation (Submitted to ICCV'25)

**May 2024 â€“ Jan 2025**  
**with Prof. Alper Yilmaz, OSU**  

- Developed a large-scale CPR dataset with 6,000 videos, featuring multi-view and multi-label annotations for fine-grained clinical action analysis. Analyzed and visualized label relationships, providing insights into the interdependencies of clinical action categories.  
- Proposed a novel Gaussian field-based method to replace ST-GCN for modeling fine-grained temporal and spatial relationships in medical actions. Achieved >90% accuracy.  
- Conducted experiments integrating RGB and joint data modalities, implementing multiple downstream tasks.
