## **"Glimmer in SUSTech": First Aid Knowledge Outreach Project (project leader):**

### 2021 till now

As the project leader of the "Glimmer in SUSTech" First Aid Knowledge Outreach Project, I led a dedicated team in providing comprehensive first aid training to both university students and residents in the surrounding communities. The training encompassed essential skills such as AED operation, CPR, wound dressing, and other first aid knowledge.

Within the campus of Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), we conducted over 30 sessions, reaching a total of more than 4,800 individuals. Our training sessions covered the entire freshman population over three years, earning widespread acclaim. Additionally, we recruited over 600 students, empowering them to serve as the first responders for medical emergencies on campus.



Beyond the university borders, we extended our outreach to ten local communities, including BaoShiZhou East Community and LongGuang Community in Shenzhen. Here, we provided vital first aid knowledge training to approximately 220 residents. Our commitment to delivering thorough and responsible training garnered encouragement and praise from the community members.
